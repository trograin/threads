This is a Threads clone with community feature and Authentication through Clerk, built with Next.js, using a MongoDB database and Tailwind for styling.

The clone is built bydollowing JS Mastery Youtube course, to get insights in Clerk and freshing up my Next.js skills in an area ( community platforms ) that I have not built before.
